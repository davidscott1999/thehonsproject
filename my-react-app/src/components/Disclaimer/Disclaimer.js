        Disclaimer Policy for Munro Baggers
      </h1>

      <p>
        At Munro Baggers , accessible from www.munrobaggers.co.uk, one of our
        main priorities is the safety of our users. We recommend that you only
        use our platform before or after your hike. This will allow you to enjoy
        the most of the outdoor environment, and ensure you are focused on
        staying safe on the hills.
      </p>

      <p>
        Munro Baggers is not responsible for your safety on the hills, and all
        guidance and advice is taken from third party organisations which
        provide mountain safety information. Please do not use this platform in
        an emergency.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using our website, you hereby consent to our disclaimer policy and
        agree to its terms.

      <p>
        If you have additional questions or require more information about our
        Disclaimer Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.
